# CPU Process Scheduler Simulator

A comprehensive C++ program that simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms used in operating systems. This educational tool demonstrates how different scheduling strategies affect process execution and system performance.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multiple Scheduling Algorithms**: Implements 5 different CPU scheduling algorithms
- **Interactive Menu System**: User-friendly command-line interface
- **Random Process Generation**: Automatically generates test processes with random burst times and priorities
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates and displays waiting time and turnaround time for each algorithm
- **Educational Focus**: Designed for learning and understanding operating system concepts

## üìã Implemented Algorithms

### 1. First Come First Served (FCFS)
- Processes are executed in the order they arrive
- Non-preemptive scheduling
- Simple but may lead to convoy effect

### 2. Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Processes with shortest burst time are executed first
- Non-preemptive scheduling
- Optimal for minimizing average waiting time

### 3. Priority Scheduling
- Processes are executed based on priority (lower number = higher priority)
- Non-preemptive scheduling
- Useful for real-time systems

### 4. Round Robin (RR)
- Processes are executed in time slices (quantum) in circular order
- Preemptive scheduling
- Prevents starvation and provides fair CPU allocation

### 5. Multilevel Queue Scheduling
- Processes are distributed into different queues
- Each queue uses a different scheduling algorithm:
  - Queue 0: Round Robin
  - Queue 1: First Come First Served (FCFS)
  - Queue 2: Shortest Job First (SJF)

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

The program includes several configurable constants:

```cpp
const int QUANTUM = 4;                    // Time quantum for Round Robin
const int DEFAULT_PROCESS_COUNT = 10;     // Default number of processes
const int MAX_BURST_TIME = 20;            // Maximum burst time
const int MIN_BURST_TIME = 1;             // Minimum burst time
const int MAX_PRIORITY = 3;               // Maximum priority level
const int MIN_PRIORITY = 1;               // Minimum priority level
const int NUM_QUEUES = 3;                 // Number of queues for multilevel
```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to Run

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (g++, Visual Studio, etc.)
- Windows/Linux/macOS operating system

### Compilation and Execution

1. **Compile the program:**
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o ProcessScheduler.exe
   ```

2. **Run the executable:**
   ```bash
   ./ProcessScheduler.exe
   ```

### Alternative (Windows)
```cmd
g++ main.cpp -o ProcessScheduler.exe
ProcessScheduler.exe
```
